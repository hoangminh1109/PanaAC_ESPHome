# Panasonic AC IR Remote Controller for ESPHome

This is a custom ESPHome external component for controlling Panasonic air conditioners via infrared.

It **inherits from ESPHome's `ClimateIR`** and adds support for:
- **IR Receiver** to detect and decode Panasonic AC remote commands (216 bit frame)
- **Temperature step** (0.5 or 1.0 degree)
- **Fan Level Control** (1‚Äì5, plus quiet)
    - Default 3 levels without quiet, can configure 5 levels and quiet separately
- **Swing Control**:
  - **Vertical Swing** (Highest, High, Middle, Low, Lowest, Auto)
  - **Horizontal Swing** (Left Max, Left, Middle, Right, Right Max, Auto)
    - Default off, can configure on.

## üì¶ Requirements

- ESP32 or ESP8266 board
You have 2 options to install ESPHome module to you AC.

- **1. Invasive way:** You must have physical access to Panasonic AC IR board
    - Wiring Panasonic AC IR board with ESP board
        - ESP GND <-> Pana AC IR board's GND
        - ESP 5V <-> Pana AC IR board's VCC (make sure your AC IR board supplies 5V)
        - ESP GPIO <--> Pana AC IR board's IR Led output

- **2. Non-invasive way:** If you don't want to mod your AC IR board (invasive way), you have choice to do as below
    - Make your own IR led receiver and IR led transmitter circuit (via transistor). Refer below schematic.
    - Connect IR led receiver circuit and IR led transmitter circuit to ESP GPIOs.

    - Configure ESPHome yaml `remote_receiver` and `remote_transmitter` with respective GPIOs.
    - One important thing is, you have to install your ESP8266 module near the the AC indoor unit:
        - It has to be able to receive signal from physical remote same as AC unit.
        - Its IR transmitter led has to point to the AC IR module, so the command sends from it can come to the AC.
    - This way, you have to additionally configure the `panaac` climate with `ir_control: True`
- **NOTE:**
    - Method 1 brings much more stability and performance, as it captures the IR signal and feeds the control command directly to AC IR board.
    - **Recommendation:** during testing phase, you can use method 2, but for long-term usage it's highly recommended to install it as method 1.

## üìÇ Installation

1. Copy `esphome/components/panaac` folder to your HASS ESPHome `components` folder.
2. Add climate component to your ESPHome YAML configuration (refer example `ac-test-1.yaml` and `ac-test-2.yaml`)

    - If you're connecting ESP GPIO directly to IR led signal pin on AC IR board (invasive way), you need to set the `remote_receiver` and `remote_transmitter` use the same GPIO pin.

        ```yaml
        remote_receiver:
            pin:
                number: GPIO4
                inverted: True
                mode: OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN
                allow_other_uses: True # needed for same pin
            tolerance: 55%
            id: ir_receiver
            idle: 5ms # required

        remote_transmitter:
            carrier_duty_percent: 50%
            pin:
                number: GPIO4
                inverted: True
                mode: OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN
                allow_other_uses: True # needed for same pin

        climate:
            - platform: panaac
                name: "Remote Controller"
                receiver_id: ir_receiver
                supports_fan_only: true
                supports_heat: true
                supports_quiet: true
                fan_5level: true
                swing_horizontal: false
                temp_step: 0.5
                ir_control: false
        ```

    - If you're installing the ESPHome device as a separated device and communicate with AC with real IR leds (non-invasive way), use different GPIO pins for `remote_receiver` and `remote_transmitter`. **Additionaly parameter `ir_control` needs to be True**.

        ```yaml
        remote_receiver:
            pin:
                number: GPIO14
                inverted: True
            tolerance: 55%
            id: ir_receiver
            idle: 5ms # required

        remote_transmitter:
            carrier_duty_percent: 50%
            pin:
                number: GPIO13

        climate:
            - platform: panaac
                name: "Remote Controller"
                receiver_id: ir_receiver
                supports_fan_only: true
                supports_heat: true
                supports_quiet: True
                fan_5level: True
                swing_horizontal: True
                temp_step: 0.5
                ir_control: True
        ```

    - **NOTE:**
        - Panasonic AC IR protocol includes 2 IR frames
            - First fixed 8-byte frame contains kind of magic number for Pana AC
            - Second 19-byte frame contains the AC state.
            - There is a frame gap 10000us (10ms).
        - Default ESPHome `remote_receiver` idle time is also 10ms.
        - Because of same duration between frame gap and `remote_receiver` idle time, it is quite unstable in recognizing IR frames
            - Sometimes it detects as a full 27-byte frame.
            - Sometimes it detects as 2 consecutive frames.
        - The trick here is set `idle: 5ms` to the `remote_receiver`, so it always splits the IR signal into 2 different frames. IR signal receiving becomes stable.
